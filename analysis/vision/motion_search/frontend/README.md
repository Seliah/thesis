# Frontend

This directory contains all frontend implementations for the motion search functionality.

These files will not work on their own, they are elements that can be included in any [angular](https://angular.io) project. Multiple angular components, modules and a service is located here.

Most interesting are the `*.component.ts`, `*.component.html` and `*.service.ts` files. These contain all business logic and HTML-templates. All `*.scss` files contain styling information, the `*.pipe.ts` files contain conversion logic for templates. The components and services are documented, as well as lines of code that are not clear right away. Most of the code relies on implicit documentation, with fitting namings and inferred type documentation, for example done by the [TypeScript Integration in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript).
