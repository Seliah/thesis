# Scripts

This folder contains programs that are not part of the prototype and are not being used at runtime.

The scripts are defined in multiple programming languages, namely Python (high level scripting language for complex scripts), Bash (Linux shell language for documenting Linux commands) and Powershell (Windows shell language for documenting Windows commands).
